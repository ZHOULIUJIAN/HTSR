Codes and Data for Heuristic Tree Searching for 3D/2D Registration

This project is related to the work of Jianjun Zhu, named "Heuristic Tree Searching for Pose-independent 3D/2D Rigid Registration of Vessel Structures". It will be published in Physics in Medicine and Biology. It is about a novel 3D to 2D registration of vessel structures using the heuristic tree searching.
